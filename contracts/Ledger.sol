/**
 * Ledger 
 *
 * The ledger keeps track of all the balance rights of the assets
 * provided as collateral across every trust. The withdrawal rights 
 * are assigned to individual keys, on a per-asset basis. To this
 * extent, the ledger itself is asset agnostic. This provides
 * powerful flexibility on the entitlement layer to move funds easily,
 * quickly, and without multiple transactions or gas.
 *
 * Conceptually, any balances associated with a Trust's root key
 * should be considered the trust's balance itself. Once the asset
 * rights have been moved to another key, they are considered outside
 * of the trust, even if they are still on the ledger.
 *
 * This contract is designed to only be called by trusted peers. 
 * Some level of public state reflection is available, any state 
 * mutation functions require a trusted contract relationship.
 *
 * All trusted relationships are managed through the ledger's
 * associated Notary, and are anointed by a root key holder.
