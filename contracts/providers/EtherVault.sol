 * EtherVault
 *

 *
 * A root key holder can deposit their funds, and entrust the
 * ledger to maintain withdrawal-rights to the vault.
 *
 * It takes the same dependency as the ledger does - the Locksmith, and uses the 
 * ERC1155 keys minted from that contract for access control.
 *
 * EtherVault requires to act as Collateral Provider to the Ledger, and relies on it
 * to deposit key holder allocation entries or verify a key balance for withdrawal.
 *
 * In the end, this contract holds the ether and abstracts out the ARN 
 * into the protocol implementation.
