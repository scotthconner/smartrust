/**
 * TrustEventLog
 *
 * The trust event log acts as a pub/sub service bus
 * for scribes to be able to react to events outside of
 * their own business logic. It enables scribe contracts to compose
 * actions based on a required number of event dependencies.
 * 
 * For instance, a trustee scribe could be optionally dependent
 * on a root key holder's death event before a trustee's
 * distribution rights are enabled.
 *
 * Events are idempotent and can only be fired once. An
 * event hash is registered by the dispatcher. The
 * event hash is generally conceived as a keccak256 hash of an
 * event's metadata. However, dispatchers will want to be careful
 * enough to design their hash scheme such that it is sufficiently
 * difficult to predict or 'attack' the event registry with bogus registrations
 * to block events firing from legitimate configurations. The best
 * way to do this is to take a string in from the key holder at
 * event registration time and use it as a salt. Block height could also
 * work. In either case, there needs to be some non-deterministic
 * element to the event hash or its hash can be predicted and registered
 * in advance of a legitimate use.
 *
 * These event hashes can then be set as event dependencies on scribe enablement,
 * necromancers, or anything else.
 *
 * This further decouples distribution powers from their 
 * enabling events. The scribe that requires an event to be fired
 * doesn't have to be aware of which dispatcher it came from, 
 * but only the dispatcher who has registered for the event hash
 * can fire it.
