/**
 * KeyLocker 
 *
 * The Key locker acts as a secure key agent. Normally, all keys (including root keys)
 * will be soulbound to their default EOAs. This ensures that key holders
 * can not easily be drained of their keys via malicious signatures or transactions.
 *
 * However, soulbound keys can not be easily moved, and thus secure access to a
 * moveable key that must be returned has the delegation benefits of account abstraction
 * without the associated security risks of losing or leaking access to untrusted third
 * parties.
 *
 * To use, an operator that has possession to an unbound key can send it
 * into the contract to create a locker. Any operator that holds the same key
 * can call #useKey to produce a delegated execution path, with the locker
 * asserting that the transaction completes with the key returned.
 *
 * Only root key holds can move the key out of the locker permanently by calling
 * #redeemKey.
 *
 * As a migration path from unbound root keys, there should be an optional
 * path into IERC1155Received to soulbind the root key, copy a new one in,
 * and send it back. This enables a user to both use the locker and create it
 * at the same time, assuming its a root key.

     * useKeys 
     *
     * A message sender is assumed to be calling this method while holding
     * a soulbound version of the key the expect to use. If held, the caller's
     * provided destination and calldata will be used to *send* the key
     * into the destination contract with associated calldata.
     *
     * It is *critical* that this interface is not extended to otherwise delegate calls
     * or call other contracts from the Locker because the locker will also hold other
     * keys.
     *
     * It is fully expected that the key will be returned to the locker by the end of
     * the transaction, or the entire transction will revert. This protects the key
     * from being arbitrarily stolen.
     *
     * It will also ensure that at the end of the transaction the message sender is
     * still holding the soulbound key, as to ensure malicious transactions cannot
     * use the Locker to somehow strip you of the permission you are using.
     *
     * It is not explicitly enforced that *other* keys cannot be removed from the caller
     * for composability. When using a root key locker for a trust, it is critical to
     * trust the destination contract.
     *
     * This method can revert for the following reasons:
     * - UNSUFFICENT_KEYS: The key locker doesn't currently hold keyId from the provided locksmith.
     * - KEY_NOT_HELD: The message sender doesn't hold the proper key to use the locker.
     * - KEY_NOT_RETURNED: The instructions didn't result in the key being returned.
