/**
 * AlarmClock 
 *
 * This contract acts as an event dispatcher by acting like an alarm clock. 
 * The root key holder for a trust will configure an event, and designate
 * a particular point when the "alarm" can go off, firing the event.
 * 
 * Because of the on-chain nature of the alarm, a key-less "challenge"
 * can occur to determine that the clock has past it's alarm point, and
 * will fire the event.
 *
 * Also, much like an alarm, it can be optionally configured to be "snoozed" 
 * by a designated key holder as determined by the root key. In this way,
 * the alarm can be postponed, and any alarm challenges will fail until
 * the new alarm datetime has been reached once more.
 * 
 * The primary design of this alarm and snooze functionality is a 
 * "dead man's switch," in that a root key holder can designate a key
 * to show "proof of life" by signing a transaction that snoozes the alarm
 * for an additional period of time. The theory is that once the key holder
 * is dead (and hasn't shared or distributed their private key), the alarm
 * will no longer snooze and a key-less challenge will fire the event.
 *
 * In combination with a beneficiary getting trustee distribution rights, enables
 * a keyholder to get access to the trust's assets once the trust originator
 * has expired to the ethereal realm.

     * method will fail if:
     *
     * - the eventHash isn't registered as an alarm with this contract     (INVALID_ALARM_EVENT)
     * - if the alarm cannot be snoozed (snoozeInterval == 0)              (UNSNOOZABLE_ALARM)
     * - the message sender does not have possession of the snooze Key Id  (KEY_NOT_HELD)
     * - if the event has already been fired                               (LATE_SNOOZE)
     * - if the caller is attempting to snooze too early                   (TOO_EARLY)
     *
     * A snooze key holder is allowed to be "late." Because the event
     * doesn't fire right upon expiry, but upon challenge, as long as the event
     * hasn't fired yet the snooze key holder can extend the alarm.
     *
     * The behavior of the snoozing is dependent on the alarm's expiry state. If
     * the snoozer shows up "early," the snooze interval will be added to the current
     * alarm's set time. If the snoozer is "late,"  the snooze interval will be added
     * to the current block's timestamp as the alarm' new alarm time.
     *
     * However, one additional failure condition applies. If a snooze is attempted
     * more than {snoozeInterval} before the alarm time, it will fail. This prevents
     * a snooze key holder from snoozing the alarm into oblivion by repeatedly calling
     * this method and stacking up multiples of snoozeInterval on the alarm time.
