 * The trustee role does *not* by nature have permission to
 * manage, deposit, or withdrawal funds from the trust. They simply
 * gain permission to distribute funds from the root key (trust) to
 * pre-configured keys on the ring based on an optional list
 * of triggering events from a dispatcher.
